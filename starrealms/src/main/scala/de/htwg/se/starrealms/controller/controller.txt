Controller:

Acts as a mediator between the model and the view.
Processes user input, updates the model, and triggers updates in the view.
Example: Controller.



Command.scala
    Encapsulates user actions (e.g., drawing a card, resetting the game) as objects, 
    decoupling input handling from the controller logic.
    The Command classes (e.g., DrawCardCommand, ResetGameCommand) belong to 
    the Controller layer because they process user input and invoke the appropriate 
    actions on the model or controller.
    The Command Pattern ensures that input handling is modular and extensible.
